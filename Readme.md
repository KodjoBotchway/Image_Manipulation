# Image Manipulation

This was a code that I learnt in my machine learning class to be able to manipulate figures in terms of the colour including the colour scaling.
As a reference, shown below this was the original image.

<!---<figure align = "center">
<img src="data/test.png" alt="Original">
<figcaption align = "center"><b>Original Image</b></figcaption>
</figure> -->

<p align = "center">
<img src = "data/test.png" style="width:25%" alt="Original">
</p>
<p align = "center">
Original
</p>

In the first image shown below, I was able to change the colour of a rectangle in the middle to black, showing a black rectangle in the middle.
<p align = "center">
<img src = "assets/output2.png" style="width:25%">
</p>
<p align = "center">
Image with the black rectangle
</p>

In the next image, the image was changed from the original colour to greyscale, changing all teh colour pixels to black or white depending on the hex code conditions.

<p align = "center">
<img src = "assets/output1.png" style="width:25%" alt="Original">
</p>
<p align = "center">
Original
</p>
